<p> The reason I made this project is to create a simple software that utilizes a database. In this case, I used SQLite because I heard it is good for storing small amounts of data which is perfect for a sample project like this one. I also wanted to refresh my Database knowledge.</p>

<b> Description: </b> This is just a simple program to replicate the basic functionalities of a banking application. The user can login, register, check their balance, deposit theoretical money, withdraw theoretical money, and check their past transactions. Withdrawing and Depositing will be recorded in a transaction table from the local database. 

# Database Design <!-- Show the Image --> 
<p> Users has a one to many relationship with transactions while transactions has only a one to one relationship with users. This means that users can have one to multiple transactions while transactions are uniquely recorded per unique individuals. </p>
