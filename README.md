# Banking-Application
Description: This is just a simple program to replicate the basic functionalities of a banking application. The user can login, register, check their balance, deposit money,
withdraw money, and check their past transactions. I've always wanted to connect a database to a project, so this was my first time doing so. I used SQLite as the database to
store and retrieve data.
